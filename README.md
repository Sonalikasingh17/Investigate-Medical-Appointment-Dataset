# Investigate-Medical-Appointment-Dataset
Analyzed a dataset to identify trends and patterns in medical appointment attendance.

##Key Findings:
20.19% of patients did not show up for their appointments.
Females are nearly twice as likely to miss their appointments compared to males.
Longer waiting periods between scheduling and appointments increase no-show likelihood.
Patients with scholarships and those who received SMS reminders are more likely to miss appointments.

##Analysis Shortcomings & Data Limitations:
Missing information on appointment hours and day types (vacation or working days).
Negative values in age and scheduling data indicating data quality issues.
